This status report should briefly summarize:
 (a) which of the P2 design requirements you believe you have satisfied
			atm_server
DONE * MUST run in its own computing process (i.e., in a dedicated terminal window).
* MUST allow multiple simultaneous ATM client connections.
* MUST communicate with ATM clients exclusively by sending and receiving messages over the network using an application-layer message protocol of your own design.
* MUST allow multiple ATM clients to send messages to the server and receive timely responses from the server. One client should never be blocked until other client(s) have completed all their transactions.
DONE * MUST validate an account's PIN code before allowing any other transactions to be performed on that account.
* MUST prevent more than one ATM client at a time from accessing a bank account and performing transactions on it.
* MUST transmit error results to the client using numeric codes rather than literal message strings.
* After a customer "logs in" to their account from an ATM client, the server MUST allow any number of transactions to be performed during that client banking session. During the session, access to the account from other ATM clients MUST be rejected.
* MUST prevent malicious client applications (i.e., other than the implemented atm_client application) from being able to send messages the server which cause the server to crash, behave incorrectly, and/or provide unauthorized access to customer bank accounts.
* The bank_server MAY generate console output for tracing and debugging purposes.
* The bank_server MUST NOT assume that any customer has access to the server's console.


Atm_client
* MUST run in its own computing process (i.e., in a dedicated terminal window).
DONE * MUST obtain all needed user inputs through keyboard interaction.
* MUST connect to only one bank_server at a time.
DONE * MUST communicate with the bank_server exclusively by sending and receiving messages over the network using an application-layer message protocol of your own design.
DONE * MUST require each banking session to being with a customer "log in" step, where the customer provides an account number and PIN which are then validated by the bank_server. 
DONE * MUST NOT allow a customer to perform any banking transactions unless their account number and PIN are first validated by the bank_server. 
* MUST allow a customer to perform any sequence of deposits, withdrawals, and balance checks after they have validated their account number and PIN.
* MUST NOT allow a customer to overdraw their bank account.

(b) the top 3 most significant knowledge or understanding gaps that are standing in your way

How to implement multiple user features.
How to store the user history?
A clear understanding of this line “communicate with the bank_server exclusively by sending and receiving messages over the network using an application-layer message protocol of your own design.”

(c) any thoughts you have about what you might do to overcome those gaps. 
I think some good ole trial and error is good for personal development.
I think I also could find more resources that explain WHY I’m doing each step in an accessible way
Go to office hours with specific questions.
